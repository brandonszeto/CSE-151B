Compare and contrast the applicability of BERT and GPT-4 in different machine learning tasks, highlighting scenarios where one model may be preferred over the other based on their respective strengths and capabilities.

\begin{tcolorbox}
BERT was designed for applications that require understanding bidirectional context, such as text classification, question answering, and entity recognition. GPT-4 was designed for generative applications with an emphasis on generating coherent and relevant text.

As a result, each model may outperform the other in given scenarios. For example, BERT may be preferred in cases where understanding context is critical such as sentiment analaysis and text summarization. On the other hand, GPT-4 may be preferred in generative tasks such as generating relevant text.
