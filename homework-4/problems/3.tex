Differentiate between unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.

\begin{tcolorbox}
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns patterns from unlabeled data without any supervision. Its main goal is to find patterns and extract insights without meaningful data. Algorithms include k nearest neighbors and principal component analysis.

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with some environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties for its actions, guiding it towards maximizing rewards. Algorithms include Q-learning.

The key differences lies in their goals and how they learn. Unsupervised learning is looking for patterns in unlabeled data, while reinforcement learning is getting feedback from its actions in some environment and learns from its past mistakes.
